# Prime Factors in Elixir

This is an example of a prime factors generator developed in a TDD style, like one would do for a a [Code Kata](http://codekata.pragprog.com).

The goal is to be able to factor out a list of primes for a given input number.

# What is Elixir?

> Elixir is a functional meta-programming aware language built on top of the Erlang VM. It is a dynamic language with flexible syntax with macros support that leverages Erlang's abilities to build concurrent, distributed, fault-tolerant applications with hot code upgrades.

More information can be found on the [Elixir website](http://elixir-lang.org).

# Executing this example

This example was built with help from [Mix](http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/mix.html).  To execute the tests, simply enter `mix test` on the command line in the top level directory for the project.

`$ pwd`
`/path/to/checkout/locaction/prime_factors_elixir`
`$ mix test`
`...`
`7 tests, 0 failures.`

# Directory structure

The modules under test is located under the `lib` directory.  The tests are located under the `test` directory.
